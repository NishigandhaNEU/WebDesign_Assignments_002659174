            <h2 style="color:palevioletred;"> ABOUT BREW’D  </h2>
            <p>You hear the sounds of the steam wand heating milk, the grinding of some freshly roasted beans, or simply a name being called from behind the counter while you sip your own cup of coffee. You are there to do some studying or some work away from the office. There may be some pleasant distractions like watching the couple next to you on their first date or the high schoolers coming in after school and being who they are  but you are away from the distractions of your every day world. This is what Brew’d is about.</p>
            <p>Brew’d Awakening Coffeehaus opened in 2005. She is a place we consider home. We want this to be a place where you feel comfortable and safe. Brew’d welcomes everyone who wants to visit and enjoy a great drink or sandwich. Open seven days a week, feel free to come in and relax with friends, families, or just solo and have a cup of coffee or tea. We have lots of options for you to choose so it is not important if you are a coffee drinker</p>
          <p>Since our opening we have used Equal Exchange Coffee because of the great offerings of Fair trade and organic coffee, espresso and chocolate. In 2015 still partnering with Equal Exchange, we began roasting our own coffee. Paying homage to the amazing Lowell cultural and art scene we branded it, The Art of Coffee.</p>
          <p>We currently offer three roasts, The Poet (Nicaraguan medium roast), The Painter (Ethiopian french roast), and The Photographer (Costa Rican full city roast and only available as Cold Brew’d). To round out our offerings we continue using Equal Exchange. Brew’d is certified by Lowell Green Restaurants. We utilize mainly biodegradable or compostable cups and to-go containers, provide discounts when using your own travel mugs, recycle and compost, and have plans in place to try to reduce electrical and water consumption behind the counter.</p>
          <p>Please say hello when you stop in for a drink.</p>
